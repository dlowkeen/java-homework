//	Project 4: (20 points) Write code to detect if there are duplicates in a
//	linked list stack or not. Make a test class that will test if the detection
//	of the duplicates works. Test your code on the following stack of Strings:
//	“top: A” → “B” → “B”→ “A”, for which your method should return
//	true. Also write a test for which the method returns false. Make sure to
//	document your code!
//	Bonus for the adventurous ones: write a code to remove the duplicates from the linked list stack. When fed with “top: A” → “B” → “B”→
//	“A”, it should update the linked list stack to contain only “top: A” →
//	“B”.
