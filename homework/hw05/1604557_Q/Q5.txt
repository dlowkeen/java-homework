Question 5. (10 points) (Graphs) Use the following description of an undirected
graph for Questions a) and b) below:
EmployeeGraph = (V, E)
V(EmployeeGraph) = {Susan, Darlene, Mike, Fred, John, Sander, Lance,
Jean, Brent, Fran}
E(EmployeeGraph) = {(Susan, Darlene), (Fred, Brent), (Sander, Susan),
(Lance, Fran),
(Sander, Fran), (Fran, John), (Lance, Jean), (Jean, Susan), (Mike, Darlene), (Brent, Lance), (Susan, John)}
(a) Draw a picture of EmployeeGraph (draw it the way graphs look like - see the book or slides)
Answer: See image attachment.

(b) Which one of the following phrases best describes the relationship
represented by the edges between the vertices in EmployeeGraph and why?
i. “works for”
ii. “is the supervisor of ”
iii. “is senior to”
iv. “works with”
Answer: iv. "works with" - The graph is an undirected graph so there is no seniority of hierarchy of
responsibility which would eliminate options i, ii, and iii.
