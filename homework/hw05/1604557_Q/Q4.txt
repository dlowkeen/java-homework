Question 4. (5 points) (Hashing from Chapter 8) Critique the following code which
is intended to print out whether or not a key value k1 is used in a map named relationships:
if (relationships.get(k1) != null)
    System.out.println("yes it does");
else
    System.out.println("no it does not");
Now rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

Answer: 
The code above is not determining whether the key k1 is used in the map. It is evaluating whether
the value of k1 is not equal to null. If the user truly intended to see if the relationships map
contains the key k1, the containsKey method could be used. 

if (map.containsKey(k1))
    System.out.println("yes it does");
else
    System.out.println("no it does not");
