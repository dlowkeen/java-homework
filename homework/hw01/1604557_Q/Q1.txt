Question 1. (2 points) What is the difference between an object and a class? Give two examples.

Answer: An object is an instantiation of a class while a class is a template for objects. 
A class defines object properties and behaviors. 

Example of a class would be a blueprint of a Dog which has properties such as color, breed and behaviors like bark. 
An actual dog would be the object.
